Problem in Shell X3:
Improper Synchronization Between Children: The parent waits for the first child (59027) to complete before forking the second child (59028). However, the second child relies on the output of the first child through the pipe. If the first child produces a large amount of data, the pipe may fill up, causing the first child to block when writing to the pipe. Since the second child is not yet running to consume data from the pipe, a deadlock can occur.





Premature Closing of Pipe Ends:


The parent closes the pipe ends (close(3) and close(4)) too early, potentially disrupting communication between the child processes.
