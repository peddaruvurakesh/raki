Task 9 Explanation and Fix
Observations in Shell X2:
The output indicates that Shell X2 is attempting to implement a pipeline, but it fails to do so correctly because the shell is interrupted (killed by SIGINT) before it can fully process the pipeline.



Key Problems:




File Descriptor Closure Timing:

The parent shell (PID 58969) closes both ends of the pipe (close(3) and close(4)) before the child processes (echo and wc) have completed their execution. This is likely causing the error.




Interrupt Handling (SIGINT):

The parent shell receives a SIGINT signal, which disrupts the pipeline execution and causes the shell to terminate prematurely.





Missing Proper Synchronization:

The wait4() call for the second process (wc, PID 58971) does not complete successfully. Instead, it returns ERESTARTSYS, which indicates that the call was interrupted by a signal.




Corrective Action:
To fix Shell X2, the parent process (PID 58969) should delay closing the pipe ends (close(3) and close(4)) until after all child processes have completed their execution. This ensures the pipe is still available when the child processes need it.




Strace Line to Add:
plaintext
Copy code
58969 wait4(58971, NULL, 0, NULL) = 58971





How to Use the Fix:
The missing line should appear before closing the pipe descriptors in the parent shell (close(3) and close(4)). Adding the wait4() call ensures that the parent waits for the second child process (wc) to complete before closing the file descriptors.






Fixed Execution Order (with the added line):
pipe([3, 4]) creates a pipe.
clone() creates the first child process (echo).

	
	
	
	Child 1:
Closes the read end of the pipe (close(3)).
Duplicates the write end to stdout (dup2(4, 1)).
Closes the write end (close(4)).
Executes echo with execve("/bin/echo", ...).
clone() creates the second child process (wc).





Child 2:
Duplicates the read end of the pipe to stdin (dup2(3, 0)).
Closes the read end (close(3)).





Executes wc with execve("/usr/bin/wc", ...).



Parent Process (PID 58969):
Waits for the first child (wait4(58970, ...)) to finish.
Waits for the second child (wait4(58971, NULL, 0, NULL)).
Closes both ends of the pipe (close(3) and close(4)).
